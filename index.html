                        Amsterdam is the capital of the Netherlands and the most populated city, reaching almost one million inhabitants. 
                        lies in the province of Noord-Holland. Because of the large amount of canals it has, it is usually referred to as the Venice of the North.
                        The name Amsterdam comes from Amstelredamme which is a reference to the city’s origin as a small fishing village around a dam on the river Amstel in the 12th century.</p>

                <p class="paragraphs bottom-half-para">One of the most culturally rich cities in all of Europe, Amsterdam is full of museums celebrating the works of great artists such as Rembrandt and Van Gogh, theatres and music halls. Festivals such as Koningsdag are celebrated by hundreds of thousands of people both living in and visiting the city.
                        Tourists are usually also fascinated by the cycling infrastructure that Amsterdam offers, cycling is not a leisure activity (although it can be), it is the main form of transport in the city, more so than both public transport and cars, everyone from kids to elderly people travels through the special bike roads that connect the entirety of the city.

                        Amsterdam is known for housing 180 different nationalities within its space, however there is one neighborhood that has the lion’s share. And that is Bos en lommer, while only 2.7 square kilometers large, 127 of these nationalities live in this small space. Dutch, Turkish, Moroccan and many other influences can be seen all over the neighborhood.

                <h2>Shopping</h2>
                <p class="shopping">
                        When it comes to shopping various stores can be found in the Bos en lommerplein, ranging from big chain clothing shops such as C&A and HEMA, to smaller family owned ones the likes of Manzaram, and even the flea market occupying the square just outside the stores, where all kinds of commodities can be found. In an area so small you can find yourself spending hours shopping without even noticing.

                </p>
                <p>
                        In the underground area of the square you’ll find three supermarkets facing off against each other, trying to snatch you away from their competitors. That is of course if you have any money left from your visit up top. 
                </p>
                <h2>Companies</h2>
                <p class="companies">
                        Bos en lommer is also home to many company branches. From housing companies such as Rochdale to house-moving services such as MBI, multiple TAXI businesses, banks, hotels, space rental agencies, travel agencies, bookstores, and even printing services.
                </p>
                <h2 id="tourist">Touristic attractions</h2>
                <p class="last-para">
                        Despite all that was mentioned above, Bos en lommer still has more than just commercial attractions to offer. Erasmus park, one of the largest green areas in Amsterdam is a breath of fresh air both literally and figuratively, throughout the whole year it never runs out of visitors, during the summer it becomes an ideal picnic location where tourists and locals alike can enjoy the sun, barbecue,playing football and overall having a good time with their loved ones. Winter has its own unique activities, mainly ice gliding, snow fights and given the large amount of snow…making snowmen. During the rest of the year, people bring their pets to the park for a stroll, others come for a run, and some just enjoy a few moments of silence sitting on the bench.
                        Podium mozaiek, an international theatre and Cafe-restaurant is another major attraction in Bos en lommer. It offers world music, theatre, exhibitions, and spoken word from national and international artists. You can also enjoy the relaxed atmosphere of the Café-restaurant before or after a show.

                    Philosophy
            </h2>
            <p class="rest">
                    Team Leidekker school’s philosophy revolves around two major points:
                    1-Having fun:
                    You are most productive when you are doing something you love; you learn the most when you are having fun and you are more energetic when what you do doesn’t feel like a chore.
                    2-Practicality:
                    Not every martial art is effective, many of them have become just a form of dancing that will make no difference in a real fight.
                    That is why in this club you are only taught proven martial arts and techniques that will hopefully save you if you happen to be attacked in the street, the school does not condone violence, but should you find yourself in such a situation, it is better to be well prepared and not have a false sense of security that many fake martial arts out there instill.
